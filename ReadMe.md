React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
It makes building complex,interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler



What is a â€œComponent"?
Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of components
Components are in the end just a combination of HTML code,
CSS code for styling
and possibly JavaScript code for some logic.
And you don't have to reuse a component
to make it a component.
It's just one of its traits that it is reusable.

a Component in react is just a function 



You build these individual components
and then you tell React how to compose them together
into a final user interface.
And React embraces this concept of components
because of that reusability aspect
and because it allows us to separate our concerns.
Both concepts are important concepts
in programming in general.
Having reusable building blocks helps us avoid repetition,
and in programming in general it is good
if we don't repeat ourselves.
Having a separation of concerns helps us
with keeping our code base small and manageable
instead of having one large file
which holds all the HTML code
and all the JavaScript logic.
For the entire user interface
we have small separated units,
these components where every component
has one clear
concern, one focus,
one specific task it focuses us on.
And if we split that code across multiple files then
as we are going to do it though out this course
then we'll have small pieces of code



Declarative Approach
Define the desired target state(s) and let React figure out the
            actual JavaScript DOM instructions# react-complete-guide
